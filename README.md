# MemoryGame - Keith Plaisance's Memory Card Game

This game is the second project in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program.

It is a memory game where the user tries to find matching cards. They are then given points each time they get a match.
There is a timer as well as a scoreboard modal that appears that provides the game statistics.

The number of commits is low. I cloned the Udacity repo and did all my work on that repo. However I only saved locally and when submitting this project, I created a GitHub account and new repo, and moved all my files over to it and pushed. Now that I have my own GitHub I'll use it and commit more to it.

I used the walkthrough by Matthew Cranford and Udacity to help figure out how to setup the game.
