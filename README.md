# MemoryGame - Keith Plaisance's Memory Card Game

This game is the second project in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program.

It is a memory game where the user tries to find matching cards. They are then given points each time they get a match.
There is a timer as well as a scoreboard modal that appears that provides the game statistics.

I used walkthrough by Matthew Cranford to help figure out how to setup the game.
